# Practical Data Privacy: Reader Contributions

These notebooks can be used separately from the book, as a workhop or self-study to learn about practical data privacy methods. They are contributed by users to help teach others and experiment with privacy and privacy technologies!

### How to Contribute

I'm hoping this book and repository has inspired you to try out new libraries and tools related to data privacy. If you try something new out, please consider contributing your notebook! To make it easier for others, please ensure you:

- Write a brief introduction to the concept or library shown in the notebook, including any links for folks to learn more. What will they learn? What does it show?
- Installation requirements
- Your name (if you'd like recognition) and any details should people want to reach out (optional!)
- Guide other readers through the notebook with occasional titles, markdown cells to take someone through the notebook when you cannot be there.
- Recommended Reading or Challenges

Feel free to send over Pull Requests once you've checked the above!

Thank you for your work and contribution, and helping others learn more about privacy!
