# Practical Data Privacy for Data Science Notebooks

Notebooks to accompany the O'Reilly release: Practical Data Privacy for Data Science.

These notebooks can also be used separately from the book, as a workhop or self-study to learn about practical data privacy methods. The audience is assumed to be a data scientist or data folks with an understanding of probability, math and data. 

### Motivation

The goal of the notebooks and the book is to help data scientists learn about practical data privacy. I hope you can use these notebooks and the book to not only learn about data privacy, but also to guide implementation of data privacy in your work!

These notebooks are not meant to replace exploring software or building sustainable, production-ready code; but instead are meant to help guide your learning and thinking around the topics. Please always try to use and support open-source libraries based on the learnings you get from these notebooks / the book.


### Installation

Please utilize the included `requirements.txt` to install your requirements using `pip` (you can also do so in `conda`. The notebooks have *only* been tested with Python 3. üôåüèª

We recommend using [virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/) or [conda environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

### Recommended Reading

Each notebook has its own section of recommended reading. I may update this README with additional reading of interest on this topic.
